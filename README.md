### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, after the third lab I felt very confident in hitting the ground running and starting the project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I was able to retreive the description for each movie but was not able to implement the pop up feature. If I had more time I would have liked to add that feature.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

When I searched up something that wasn't a word I would just get a blank page and the load button. Next time I will try to break my code more to find more similar issues. 
### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I would like to shout out all my fellow mentees for helping me during the work sessions. Also, Paige and Matt for being very encouring and making me feel less overwhlemed early on in the week.
